Katabasis
Good day to One and All and welcome to part

45 of Encyclopedia Hermetica.

Now since we’re still well into Antiquity,
I’m going to take the opportunity to do

a less historical or chronological talk, and
do something thematically based today, where

I’ll mostly be hopping all over the place
– so please forgive me in advance if this

seems a bit more disorganized than usual,
I recently haven’t had as much time to work

on my lectures, but I still think we’re
going to cover a lot of useful ground.

And so my theme today is something which will
become increasingly more and more important

to the overall history of Hermeticism, and
that is the theme of the out of body experience

– or at least, how these were interpreted
and related in ancient literature.

It doesn’t matter if you’re Ishtar, Odysseus,
Aeneas, Herakles, Orpheus, Paul of Tarsus,

Apuleius, Mohammad, Dante or whatever – when
you left your body, you went on a relatively

standardized journey, either to Hades (the
Katabasis – the downward journey), or to

the Heavenly spheres above (the Anabasis,
the upward journey) – or both!

(It seems to me that both was more often the
case than not).

Jesus, as the archetypal hero, does this on
the cross after he undergoes kenosis – he

empties himself and goes down into the vaults
of Sheol in what’s traditionally called

the Harrowing of Hell.

Then, at the ascension, he undergoes anabasis
(arguably this happens at other points too,

such as on the Mount of Transfiguration).

You find this stuff in mystical Jewish Hekalot
literature, which eventually fed into Kabbalah,

you find this in all the gnostic Ogdoadic
ascent literature (literature concerning the

Eight spheres, or layers of creation, such
as The Eighth Reveals the Ninth, and that

sort of stuff we get in the Nag Hammadi Library).

There’s very evidently a common thread running
through all of these narratives, and this

is something I think is worth exploring – mind
you, I don’t plan on going full Blavatsky

and telling you this is the hidden revelation
of the ascended masters and their septinary

system…

If that’s the sort of thing you’re looking
for, you can just go straight to the Secret

Doctrine and get it from the horses’ mouth.

I will, however, be getting close, what with
casting historicity to the wind to get a little

comparative, and I know that’s not fashionable
anymore in the History of Religions, but whatever,

this is for the occultists in the audience.

Now, my plan was to do this all in one lecture,
but I realized there was just too much to

go through on this subject to do it in one
part – so I’ve decided to break it up

into two sections: one on Katabasis (descent
into the underworld), and another on Anabasis

(ascent into the heavens).

So 
the term κατάβασις (and likewise

its opposite), comes from the Ancient Greek
κατὰ "down" and βαίνω "go" – it’s

a word that has a lot of uses, some far more
mundane (like a walk down to the market, or

a march up country, such in the case of Xenophon’s
Anabasis into Persia).

Now that being said, sometimes this word is
used in a mundane sense, but it carries the

connotation of a descent into the underworld;
so in the case of Plato's Republic, right

in the opening scene, Socrates recounts how
he "went down" [κατέβην ("I went down")]

to the port city of Piraeus, located just
south of Athens.

For Plato, it was as if leaving that beacon
of civilization called Athens was nothing

more than a journey into hell… or at the
very least, a step outside of nomos (law),

and into physis (nature) – false dichotomy
by the way.

Now, my hunch, and I’ve been thinking about
this intensely for years, is that the motif

of the katabasis stretches back into pre-agricultural
times – into shamanic times.

The katabasis was synonymous with the low
point of a quest for understanding – and

I think this idea first came about from shamanic
initiations: from spirit or vision quests,

if you will, where individuals were put into
altered states of consciousness (whether by

dance, drug, exhaustion, fasting, incubation,
self-mutilation, or all of the above).

And now, on account of this seemingly hypernatural
phenomena, people started to map out inner-space.

The similarity between death and ecstasy (that
is, standing outside of oneself) was not lost

on the ancients: in Greco-Roman mythology,
heroes such as Aeneas, Orpheus and Odysseus

– as we’ll see - performed κατάβασεις,
or ‘descents,’ where they communed with

the earth or the plant world (so for example,
a blood sacrifice, or the golden bough, etc.)

and then, on account of their virtue, were
given the power to transect worlds with the

risk of never returning – Mircea Eliade
liked to call this a “Rupture of Planets”.

Now my belief in regards to this κατάβασις
motif was in all probability the poetic result

of an attempt to render, into words, the old
shamanic practice of incubation (in a cave,

or otherwise) in pursuit of out-of-body experiences
(or inward journeys to the lands of the dead).

This is where people explore their inner psyches,
and this is what gives people the abilities

to literally map heaven and hell – and the
resulting literature is brilliant and all

over the place.

So if you were to ask me, did Dante really
go to Hell?

I think in his mind’s eye he really did,
and I also think he was preceded by many a

man he meets along the way.

Here’s what he tells us in the opening lines
of the Inferno:

Midway upon the journey of our life
I found myself within a forest dark [this,

of course, being the dark night of the soul],
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

Ah me!

how hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,

Which in the very thought renews the fear.

So bitter is it, death is little more;
But of the good to treat, which there I found,

Speak will I of the other things I saw there.

I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
So full was I of slumber at the moment

In which I had abandoned the true way.

Now, this notion of maps of heaven and hell
– these were first experienced, then vulgarized,

if you will (they were compressed into recognizable
words, then extended into people’s minds

through complex myths) – the descent into
hell became an integral part of the archetypical

hero’s journey, which has been recapitulated
over and over in so many ways.

But what this signifies for everyone then,
that is, when approached from a psychological

perspective, is that the journey to the underworld
is a journey into a basal state of consciousness:

one steps down into pure chaos, one is dismembered,
one is tormented by one’s past actions,

one is drunk on forgetfulness, or harangued
by furies, and one has got to stitch themselves

back together.

This part of the journey is the dark night
of the soul [Dante’s “forest dark”],

when the pull of the infernal dimensions is
stronger than those of the celestial, rather

than in balance; where it is necessary for
the weary soul to make the hero’s journey

back to the land of the living, lest he become
one among the powerless and gibbering shades.

Now here’s the thing – crisis can come
about naturally, or it can be simulated.

Dante was by no means the first who’s mind
was freed to map hell.

Through all kinds of shamanic techniques that
I just listed, one can be hurled headlong

into a short-term one-man micro-crisis with
relative ease, and ignite a sort of personal

ezkaton where the flood-gate of dreams is
opened up, and one is forced to swim in its

torrential floods and whirling eddies.

Y’know, no initiate ventured past the gates
of a mystery school with the expectations

of having a good party, unless of course they
were looking to profane the mysteries.

When the 2nd century Roman lawyer Apuleius’
character Lucius in his novel called the Metamorphosis,

he is confronted by a priest about his initiation
into the rites of Isis, and he answers: “The

gates of hell and the power of life are in
the hands of the goddess, and the very act

of dedication is regarded as a voluntary death
and an imperilling of life.”

In retelling his initiation, he tells of his
own descent into hell, but also subsequently

into the heavens (you need both for the whole
experience):

“Listen then, but believe; for what I tell
you is the truth.

I came to the boundary of death and after
treading Proserpine’s threshold I returned

having traversed all the elements; at midnight
I saw the sun shining with brilliant light;

I approached the gods below and the gods above
face to face and worshipped them in their

actual presence.

Now I have told you what, though you have
heard it, you cannot know.

So all that can without sin be revealed to
the understanding of the uninitiated, that

and no more I shall relate.”

Now I should probably mention that out-of-body
experiences provoked by an overdose of hallucinogenic

or deliriant substances can appear indistinguishable
from the hallucinations onset by life-threatening

fevers, bouts of temporary psychosis, extreme
exhaustion, and near-death experiences – because

ultimately, we are drugs.

Long before the introduction of alcohol, ecstatic
specialists could have availed themselves

of all manner of plants and fungi with “oracular”
properties of various hallucinogenic mushrooms

(Amanita muscaria and possibly various types
of coprophilic Psilocybin-containing mushrooms);

opium (Papaver somniferum); ‘jimsonweed,’
‘horsemad,’ or ‘thorn apple’ (Datura

stramonium); mandrake root (Mandragora officinarum);
cannabis; deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna);

henbane (Hyoscyamus niger); various rues and
DMT-containing reeds, shrubs, and trees; or

even combinations of these.

All of these can be used to trigger a personal
Katabasis or anabasis, and I really think

we can’t understand the importance of these
things as catalysts for visionary states.

These are not the sine qua non of the experience,
but they’re the easiest way to reach them

– y’know, why learn to walk on water when
the boatman charges you a penny.

That being said, there was obviously knowledge
that these sorts of states could be achieved

by other means.

Plato’s myth of Er (Republic, 10.614-10.621)
features a kind of philosophical katabasis

narrative wherein a man has a near death experience
during a battle and suddenly awakes ten days

later atop his own funeral pyre, just about
to be burned.

During his journey through the afterlife,
Er found himself immersed in a strikingly

DMT-like metaphysical dream world with four
giant portals, two above and two below, where

the disembodied souls of the dead were accordingly
being sent off to dwell.

Now, the fear of death would have been ever
present for an initiate launched into states

of overwhelming intoxication, or extreme fasting,
and leading up to an out-of-body experience

the process of self-dissolution can be unbearable
– especially among those who ‘resist’

the experience.

In such experiences a shaman or priest often
acts as a psychopomp and guide for the dying

or ecstatic soul – this became absorbed
into the literary tradition in the form of

all kinds of gods and guides.

But in any case we’re getting ahead of ourselves.

As the Emerald Tablet’s axiom goes – that
which is above is unto that which is below

– and vice-versa.

The shamanic experience (the personal ezkaton),
gleans truths about the hidden psyche of man

(that symbolic hidden inner life) but it also
acts as a map or a cosmological model for

explaining the construction of the universe
– the lesser man writ large.

Now, I’m going to read you an English translation
of one of the oldest extant Katabasis stories

ever carved into clay – this is a Babylonian/Akkadian
account of Ishtar’s descent (who was first

the Sumerian Innana) – and remember – a
picture is worth a thousand words, but a symbol

is worth a thousand pictures, these myths
operate on numerous levels of existence…

I don’t want to say this is the mother of
all stories… but it definitely has it’s

echoes throughout the Mediterranean world’s
mystery traditions, from the Orphic myths,

to the rape of Persephone, to the Fall of
Sophia in Gnosticism, to the emanation of

God into the material world through the Sephiroth,
and so on and so forth – the Soul falls

into the underworld that is Matter, or the
Sensible, and then makes for its inevitable

return - so here we go…

 
The DESCENT OF THE GODDESS ISHTAR INTO THE

LOWER WORLD
[this is a very old translation, done by Morris

Jastrow, 1915]

To the land of no return, the land of darkness,
Ishtar, the daughter of Sin [the Moon] directed

her thought,
To the house of shadows, the dwelling, of

Irkalla [Hades],
To the house without exit for him who enters

therein,
To the road, whence there is no turning,

To the house without light for him who enters
therein,

The place where dust is their nourishment,
clay their food.'

They have no light, in darkness they dwell.

Clothed like birds, with wings as garments,
Over door and bolt, dust has gathered.

Ishtar on arriving at the gate of the land
of no return,

To the gatekeeper thus addressed herself:

"Gatekeeper, ho, open thy gate!

Open thy gate that I may enter!

If thou openest not the gate to let me enter,
I will break the door, I will wrench the lock,

I will smash the door-posts, I will force
the doors.

I will bring up the dead to eat the living.

And the dead will outnumber the living."

The gatekeeper opened his mouth and spoke,
Spoke to the lady Ishtar:

"Desist, O lady, do not destroy it.

I will go and announce thy name to my queen
Ereshkigal [The Earth Mother]."

The gatekeeper entered and spoke to Ereshkigal:
"Ho! here is thy sister, Ishtar ...

Hostility of the great powers ...
When Ereshkigal heard this,

As when one hews down a tamarisk she trembled,
As when one cuts a reed, she shook:

"What has moved her heart [seat of the intellect]
what has stirred her liver [seat of the emotions]?

Ho there, does this one wish to dwell with
me?

To eat clay as food, to drink dust as wine?

I weep for the men who have left their wives.

I weep for the wives torn from the embrace
of their husbands;

For the little ones cut off before their time.

Go, gatekeeper, open thy gate for her,
Deal with her according to the ancient decree."***

The gatekeeper went and opened his gate to
her:

Enter, O lady, let Cuthah greet thee.

Let the palace of the land of no return rejoice
at thy presence!

[So here’s where the narrative concerning
the seven gates begin, these would later be

known as Archons, or Rulers, but it’s easiest
to conceive of these as the 7 visible planets

(which, again, symbolic of the Universe’s
intellectual filing cabinets – some from

among you might detect similarities to the
Chakras in terms of the placement of the objects

being removed, from the Ajna Crown to the
Muladhara loincloth) – but ultimately, what’s

happening is that the Goddess is stripping
away her raiment and fineries, and [ironically]

changing from a subtler to a grosser state.

He bade her enter the first gate, which he
opened wide, and took the large crown off

her head:
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the large

crown off my head?"

"Enter, O lady, such are the decrees of Ereshkigal."

The second gate he bade her enter, opening
it wide, and removed her earrings:

"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my earrings?"

"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of
Ereshkigal."

The third gate he bade her enter, opened it
wide, and removed her necklace:

"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my necklace?

"
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of

Ereshkigal."

The fourth gate he bade her enter, opened
it wide, and removed the ornaments of her

breast:
"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the ornaments

of my breast?

"
"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of

Ereshkigal."

The fifth gate he bade her enter, opened it
wide, and removed the girdle of her body studded

with birthstones.

"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the girdle
of my body, studded with birth-stones?"

"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of
Ereshkigal."

The sixth gate, he bade her enter, opened
it wide, and removed the spangles off her

hands and feet.

"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove the spangles
off my hands and feet?"

"Enter, O lady, for thus are the decrees of
Ereshkigal."

The seventh gate he bade her enter, opened
it wide, and removed her loin-cloth.

"Why, O gatekeeper, dost thou remove my loin-cloth
?"

"Enter, O lady, for such are the decrees of
Ereshkigal."

Now when Ishtar had gone down into the land
of no return,

Ereshkigal saw her and was angered at her
presence.

Ishtar, without reflection, threw herself
at her [in a rage].

Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke,
To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed herself:

"Go Namtar, imprison her in my palace.

Send against her sixty disease, to punish
Ishtar.

Eye-disease against her eyes,
Disease of the side against her side,

Foot-disease against her foot,
Heart-disease against her heart,

Head-disease against her head,
Against her whole being, against her entire

body."

After the lady Ishtar had gone down into the
land of no return,

The bull did not mount the cow, the ass approached
not the she-ass,

To the maid in the street, no man drew near
The man slept in his apartment,

The maid slept by herself.

[The second half of the poem, the reverse
of the tablet, continues is follows:]

The countenance of Papsukal, the messenger
of the great gods, fell, his face was troubled.

In mourning garb he was clothed, in soiled
garments clad.

Shamash [the sun-god] went to Sin [the moon-god],
his father, weeping,

In the presence of Ea, the King, he went with
flowing tears.

"Ishtar has descended into the earth and has
not come up.

The bull does not mount the cow, the ass does
not approach the she-ass.

The man does not approach the maid in the
street,

The man sleeps in his apartment,
The maid sleeps by herself."

Ea, in the wisdom of his heart, formed a being,
He formed Asu-shu-namir the eunuch.

Go, Asu-shu-namir, to the land of no return
direct thy face!

The seven gates of the land without return
be opened before thee,

May Eresbkigal at sight of thee rejoice!

After her heart has been assuaged, her liver
quieted,

Invoke against her the name of the great gods,
Raise thy head direct thy attention to the

khalziku skin.

"Come, lady, let them give me the khalziku
skin, that I may drink water out of it."

When Ereshkigal heard this, she struck her
side, bit her finger,

Thou hast expressed a wish that can not be
granted.

Go, Asu-sbu-iaamir, I curse thee with a great
curse,

The sweepings of the gutters of the city be
thy food,

The drains of the city be thy drink,
The shadow of the wall be thy abode,

The thresholds be thy dwelling-place;
Drunkard and sot strike thy cheek!"

Ereshkigal opened her mouth and spoke,
To Namtar, her messenger, she addressed herself.

"Go, Namtar, knock at the strong palace,
Strike the threshold of precious stones,

Bring out the Anunnaki [those from on High],
seat them on golden thrones.

Sprinkle Ishtar with the waters of life and
take her out of my presence.

Namtar went, knocked at the strong palace,
Tapped on the threshold of precious stones.

He brought out the Anunnaki and placed them
on golden thrones,

He sprinkled Ishtar with the waters of life
and took hold of her.

Through the first gate he led her out and
returned to her her loin-cloth.

Through the second gate he led her out and
returned to her the spangles of her hands

and feet
Through the third gate he led her out and

returned to her the girdle of her body, studded
with birth-stones.

Through the fourth gate he led her out and
returned to her the ornaments of her breast.

Through the fifth gate he led her out and
returned to her her necklace.

Through the sixth gate he led her out and
returned her earrings.

Through the seventh gate he led her out and
returned to her the large crown for her head.

[The following lines are in the form of an
address -apparently to some one who has sought

release for a dear one from the portals of
the lower world.]

"If she (Ishtar) will not grant thee her release,
To Tammuz, the lover of her youth,

Pour out pure waters, pour out fine oil;
With a festival garment deck him that he may

play on the flute of lapis lazuli,
That the votaries may cheer his liver.

[his spirit]
Belili [sister of Tammuz] had gathered the

treasure,
With precious stones filled her bosom.

When Belili heard the lament of her brother,
she dropped her treasure,

She scattered the precious stones before her,
"Oh, my only brother, do not let me perish!

On the day when Tammuz plays for me on the
flute of lapis lazuli, playing it for me with

the porphyry ring.

Together with him, play ye for me, ye weepers
and lamenting women!

That the dead may rise up and inhale the incense."

[END]
Now obviously there are all kinds of interpretations

for this story – it’s a cute fairy tale,
a spiritual allegory, it’s an aetiological

myth about the cycle of death and rebirth
inherent in nature, and so on and so forth

– what makes myths and symbols great is
that they operate on many levels (they’re

polysemic) – now, historically speaking,
this was probably intended as an aetiological

myth over the cycle of the seasons; but I
think over centuries of elaboration, local

variation, philosophical analysis and so forth,
these stories were recognized for their ability

to initiate people into the mysteries of existence…
this is why the Mysteries of Zagreus and the

Titans, of Isis and Osiris, of Persephone
and Demeter, of Attis and Cybele, and so on

and so forth, all tap into aspects of this
Ur-Narrative.

If you want a real good Neoplatonic reading
of this mystery school material, you’d be

best looking into the works of Julian the
Apostate who had all manner of in depth analyses

over the subject of the Mother of All the
Gods.

Now, jumping out of chronological order (and
I’ll come back to some more ancient narratives

later), I want to read you something from
the New Testament, to see how – over millennia

– this myth was vulgarized and transformed
into a spiritual allegory – a Nostos narrative,

that is, a narrative about the return home
– when the Atma (or the world soul, the

God above God of which we are all but facets),
makes a journey into the abyss (the phenomenal

world) to find out who and what it was all
along, before returning to the pleroma.

It’s about the oscillation between the One
and the Many, as if the Universe is playing

Hide-and-Seek with itself, climbing up and
down the Tree of Life, out from the realm

of Pure Potentiality, into the ever-shifting
and corruptible realm of Actuality, and back.

So here it goes… and if anyone is familiar
with the Myth of the Pearl, I want you to

keep that one especially in mind while I read
this – I want you to see behind the mundaneness

of this account:
The Parable of the Lost Son

Jesus continued: “There was a man who had
two sons.

The younger one said to his father, ‘Father,
give me my share of the estate.’

So he divided his property between them.

“Not long after that, the younger son got
together all he had, set off for a distant

country, and there he squandered his wealth
in wild living.

After he had spent everything, there was a
severe famine in that whole country, and he

began to be in need.

So he went and hired himself out to a citizen
of that country, who sent him to his fields

to feed pigs.

He longed to fill his stomach with the pods
that the pigs were eating, but no one gave

him anything.

“When he came to his senses, he said, ‘How
many of my father’s hired servants have

food to spare, and here I am starving to death!

I will set out and go back to my father and
say to him: Father, I have sinned against

heaven and against you.

I am no longer worthy to be called your son;
make me like one of your hired servants.’

So he got up and went to his father.

“But while he was still a long way off,
his father saw him and was filled with compassion

for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms
around him and kissed him.

“The son said to him, ‘Father, I have
sinned against heaven and against you.

I am no longer worthy to be called your son.’

“But the father said to his servants, ‘Quick!

Bring the best robe and put it on him.

Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his
feet.

Bring the fattened calf and kill it.

Let’s have a feast and celebrate.

For this son of mine was dead and is alive
again; he was lost and is found.’

So they began to celebrate.

“Meanwhile, the older son was in the field.

When he came near the house, he heard music
and dancing.

So he called one of the servants and asked
him what was going on.

‘Your brother has come,’ he replied, ‘and
your father has killed the fattened calf because

he has him back safe and sound.’

“The older brother became angry and refused
to go in.

So his father went out and pleaded with him.

But he answered his father, ‘Look!

All these years I’ve been slaving for you
and never disobeyed your orders.

Yet you never gave me even a young goat so
I could celebrate with my friends.

But when this son of yours who has squandered
your property with prostitutes comes home,

you kill the fattened calf for him!’

“‘My son,’ the father said, ‘you are
always with me, and everything I have is yours.

But we had to celebrate and be glad, because
this brother of yours was dead and is alive

again; he was lost and is found.’”

Now this is one of those stories in the New
Testament, along with the allegory of the

lost sheep and a number of others involving
debts, which are often used to argue in favour

of gnostic trans-valuation (that is, the inversion
of morals, also known in occult circles as

the Left Hand Path).

But here I am drawing attention to the Soteriological
dimension.

I was lost, but now I am found.

Now, throughout the history of the West, as
people’s dualistic conceptions intensified

at the expense of more monist visions of the
world, their need to be “saved” from something

likewise grew.

Language, the discovery of the mind, the proliferation
of religion and philosophy – this was the

gradual hypostasis of the Great One Thing,
which separated us, alienated us, and made

us long for a blessed fatherland an Eden.

The larger the chasm appeared between the
immanent and the transcendent, the more fervently

the world conceived of itself in terms of
a lost child, lost in a cave with shadows

on the wall; and the more lost people felt
in the world, the more stories they told about

a soul that fell from the state of perfection,
and was saved in the end.

We gradually turned the Earth into more and
more of a hell, and our need to be saved from

it proportionally grew.

By Late Antiquity, most Pagans and Christians
alike were fully entrenched in this vision

of the world – even Homer’s Odyssey was
reinterpreted as an allegory of the soul’s

journey into manifestation, then back toward
the One.

One of the most popular myths which primed
Greek consciousness for this mode of thinking

was at the Heart of the Eleusinian mysteries,
and that of course was the story of Demeter

and Persephone.

Now I think the only way I can do it justice
is by reading you an English translation of

the Homeric Hymn, but I’m going to give
you an abridged version because it’s rather

long… for some reason there’s a bunch
of untranslated Greek words transliterated

in this particular text, so I’ll tell you
what they are as I go (unless the specific

word slips my memory).

1 I begin to sing of Demeter, the holy goddess
with the beautiful hair.

And her daughter [Persephone] too.

The one with the delicate ankles, whom Hadês
seized.

She was given away by Zeus, the loud-thunderer,
the one who sees far and wide.

Demeter did not take part in this, she of
the golden double-axe, she who glories in

the harvest.

5 She [Persephone] was having a good time,
along with the daughters of Okeanos, who wear

their girdles slung low.

She was picking flowers: roses, crocus, and
beautiful violets.

Up and down the soft meadow.

Iris blossoms too she picked, and hyacinth.

And the narcissus, which was grown as a lure
for the flower-faced girl

by Gaia [Earth].

All according to the plans of Zeus.

She [Gaia] was doing a favor for the one who
receives many guests [Hadês].

10 It [the narcissus] was a wondrous thing
in its splendor.

To look at it gives a sense of holy awe
to the immortal gods as well as mortal humans.

It has a hundred heads growing from the root
up.

Its sweet fragrance spread over the wide skies
up above.

And the earth below smiled back in all its
radiance.

So too the churning mass of the salty sea.

15 She [Persephone] was filled with a sense
of wonder, and she reached out with both hands

to take hold of the pretty plaything.[2] And
the earth, full of roads leading every which

way, opened up under her.

It happened on the Plain of Nysa.

There it was that the Lord who receives many
guests made his lunge.

He was riding on a chariot drawn by immortal
horses.

The son of Kronos.

The one known by many names.

He seized her against her will, put her on
his golden chariot,

20 And drove away as she wept.

She cried with a piercing voice,
calling upon her father [Zeus], the son of

Kronos, the highest and the best.

But not one of the immortal ones, or of human
mortals,

heard her voice.

Not even the olive trees which bear their
splendid harvest.

Except for the daughter of Persaios, the one
who keeps in mind the vigor of nature.

25 She heard it from her cave.

She is Hekatê, with the splendid headband.

And the Lord Helios [Sun] heard it too, the
magnificent son of Hyperion.

They heard the daughter calling upon her father,
the son of Kronos.

But he, all by himself,
was seated far apart from the gods, inside

a temple, the precinct of many prayers.

He was receiving beautiful sacrificial rites
from mortal humans.

30 She was being taken, against her will,
at the behest of Zeus,

by her father’s brother, the one who makes
many sêmata, the one who receives many guests,

the son of Kronos, the one with many names.

On the chariot drawn by immortal horses.

So long as the earth and the star-filled sky
were still within the goddess’s [Persephone’s]

view, as also the fish-swarming sea [pontos],
with its strong currents,

35 as also the rays of the sun, she still
had hope that she would yet see

her dear mother and that special group, the
immortal gods.

For that long a time her great noos was soothed
by hope, distressed as she was.

The peaks of mountains resounded, as did the
depths of the sea [pontos],

with her immortal voice.

And the Lady Mother [Demeter] heard her.

40 And a sharp akhos seized her heart.

The headband on her hair
she tore off with her own immortal hands

and threw a dark cloak over her shoulders.

She sped off like a bird, soaring over land
and sea,

looking and looking.

But no one was willing to tell her the truth
[etêtuma],

45 not one of the gods, not one of the mortal
humans,

not one of the birds, messengers of the truth
[etêtuma].

Thereafter, for nine days did the Lady Demeter
wander all over the earth, holding torches

ablaze in her hands.

Not once did she take of ambrosia and nectar,
sweet to drink,

50 in her grief, nor did she bathe her skin
in water.

But when the tenth bright dawn came upon her,
Hekatê came to her, holding a light ablaze

in her hands.

She came with a message, and she spoke up,
saying to her:

“Lady Demeter, bringer of hôrai, giver
of splendid gifts,

55 which one of the gods who dwell in the
sky or which one of mortal humans

seized Persephone and brought grief to your
philos thûmos?

I heard the sounds, but I did not see with
my eyes

who it was.

So I quickly came to tell you everything,
without error.”

So spoke Hekatê.

But she was not answered
60 by the daughter [Demeter] of Rhea with

the beautiful hair.

Instead, she [Demeter] joined her [Hekatê]
and quickly

set out with her, holding torches ablaze in
her hands.

They came to Hêlios, the seeing-eye of gods
and men.

They stood in front of his chariot-team, and
the resplendent goddess asked this question:

“Helios!

Show me respect [aidôs], god to goddess,
if ever

65 I have pleased your heart and thûmos in
word or deed.

It is about the girl born to me, a sweet young
seedling, renowned for her beauty,

whose piercing cry I heard resounding through
the boundless aether,

as if she were being forced, though I did
not see it with my eyes.

I turn to you as one who ranges over all the
earth and sea [pontos]

70 as you look down from the bright aether
with your sunbeams:

tell me without error whether you have by
any chance seen my philon child,

and who has taken her away from me by force,
against her will,

and then gone away?

Tell me which one of the gods or mortal humans
did it.”

So she spoke.

And the son of Hyperion answered her with
these words:

75 “Daughter of Rhea with the beautiful
hair, Queen Demeter!

You shall know the answer, for I greatly respect
you and feel sorry for you

as you grieve over your child, the one with
the delicate ankles.

No one else
among all the immortals is responsible [aitios]

except the cloud-gatherer Zeus himself,
who gave her to Hadês as his beautiful wife.

So he gave her to his own brother.

And he [Hadês], heading for the misty realms
of darkness,

80 seized her as he drove his chariot and
as she screamed out loud.

But I urge you, goddess: stop your loud cry
of lamentation: you should not

have an anger without bounds, all in vain.

It is not unseemly
to have, of all the immortals, such a son-in-law

as Hadês, the one who makes many sêmata.

85 He is the brother [of Zeus], whose seed
is from the same place.

And as for tîmê,
he has his share, going back to the very beginning,

when the three-way division of inheritance
was made.[3]

He dwells with those whose king he was destined
by lot to be.”[4]

So saying, he shouted to his horses, and they
responded to his command

as they swiftly drew the speeding chariot,
like long-winged birds.

90 And she [Demeter] was visited by grief
[akhos] that was even more terrible than before:

it makes you think of the Hound of Hadês.

In her anger at the one who is known for his
dark clouds, the son of Kronos,

she shunned the company of gods and lofty
Olympus.

She went away, visiting the cities of humans,
with all their fertile landholdings,

shading over her appearance, for a long time.

And not one of men,
95 looking at her, could recognize her.

Not one of women, either, who are accustomed
to wear their girdles low-slung.[5]

Until, one day, she came to the house of bright-minded
Keleos,

who was at that time ruler of Eleusis, fragrant
with incense.[6]

She sat down near the road, sad in her philon
heart,

at the well called Parthenion [the Virgin’s
Place], where the people of the polis[7] used

to draw water.

100 She sat in the shade, under the thick
growth of an olive tree,

looking like an old woman who had lived through
many years and who is

deprived of giving childbirth and of the gifts
of Aphrodite, lover of garlands in the hair…

Alright, so here there’s a long section
I’ve cut out describing how Demeter is taken

in among the people of Eleusis, where she
integrates and serves as a wet-nurse to a

child in all her sadness – she tries to
make the child immortal through some kind

of ritual, but his mother catches Demeter
passing him through a flame, and she freaks

out and Demeter leaves, but not without making
it known that they’d wronged a goddess – so

they built a giant temple to her to appease
her… but this didn’t help, because her

daughter Persephone was still lost to her
in the underworld.

300 They built it as he ordered.

And the temple grew bigger and bigger, taking
shape through the dispensation of the daimôn.[35]

When the people had finished their work and
paused from their labor,

they all went home.

But blond-haired Demeter
sat down and stayed there [in the temple],

shunning the company of all the blessed ones
[the gods].

She was wasting away with yearning for her
daughter with the low-slung girdle.

305 She made that year the most terrible one
for mortals, all over the Earth, the nurturer

of many.

It was so terrible, it makes you think of
the Hound of Hadês.

The Earth did not send up
any seed.

Demeter, she with the beautiful garlands in
her hair, kept them [the seeds] covered underground..

Many a curved plough was dragged along the
fields by many an ox—all in vain.

Many a bright grain of wheat fell into the
earth—all for naught.

310 At this moment, she [Demeter] could have
destroyed the entire race of humans

with harsh hunger, thus depriving of their
tîmê

the dwellers of the Olympian abodes—[the
tîmê of] sacrificial portions of meat for

eating or for burning,[37]
if Zeus had not noticed with his noos, taking

note in his thûmos.

First, he sent Iris, with the golden wings,
to summon

315 Demeter with the splendid hair, with a
beauty that is much loved.

That is what he told her to do.

And she obeyed Zeus, the one with the dark
clouds, the son of Kronos,

and she ran the space between sky and earth
quickly with her feet.[38]

She arrived at the city of Eleusis, fragrant
with incense,

and she found in the temple Demeter, the one
with the dark robe.

320 Addressing her, she spoke winged words:
“Demeter!

Zeus, the one who has unwilting [a-phthi-ta]
knowledge, summons you

to come to that special group, the company
of the immortal gods.

So then, come!

May what my words say, which come from Zeus,
not fail to be turned into action that is

completed.”

So she spoke, making an entreaty.

But her [Demeter’s] thûmos was not persuaded.

325 After that, the Father sent out all the
other blessed and immortal gods.

They came one by one,
they kept calling out to her, offering many

beautiful gifts,
all sorts of tîmai that she could choose

for herself if she joined the company of the
immortal gods.

But no one could persuade her in her thinking
or in her intention [noêma],

330 angry as she was in her thûmos, and she
harshly said no to their words.

She said that she would never go to fragrant
Olympus,

that she would never send up the harvest of
the earth,

until she saw with her own eyes her daughter,
the one with the beautiful looks.

But when the loud-thunderer, the one who sees
far and wide, heard this,

335 he sent to Erebos [Hadês] the one with
the golden wand, the Argos-killer

[Hermes],[39]
so that he may persuade Hadês, with gentle

words,
that he allow holy Persephone to leave the

misty realms of darkness
and be brought up to the light in order to

join the daimones [the gods in Olympus], so
that her mother may

see her with her own eyes and then let go
of her anger.

340 Hermes did not disobey, but straightaway
he headed down beneath the depths of the earth,

rushing full speed, leaving behind the abode
of Olympus.

And he found the Lord inside his palace,
seated on a funeral couch, along with his

duly acquired bedmate,
the one who was much under duress, yearning

for her mother, and suffering from the unbearable
things

345 inflicted on her by the will of the blessed
ones.[40]

Going near him [Hadês] and stopping, the
powerful Argos-killer said to him:

“Hadês!

Dark-haired one!

King of the dead!

Zeus the Father orders that I have splendid
Persephone

brought back up to light from Erebos back
to him and his company, so that her mother

350 may see her with her own eyes and let
go of her wrath and terrible mênis

against the immortals.

For she [Demeter] is performing a mighty deed,
to destroy [root phthi-] the tribes of earth-born

humans, causing them to be without menos,
by hiding the Seed underground—and she is

destroying [root phthi-] the tîmai
of the immortal gods.[41] She has a terrible

anger, and she refuses
355 to keep company with the gods.

Instead, far removed, she is seated inside
a temple fragrant with incense.

She has taken charge of the rocky citadel
of Eleusis.”

So he spoke.

Hadês, King of the Dead, smiled
with his brows,[42] and he did not disobey

the order of Zeus the King.

Swiftly he gave an order to bright-minded
Persephone.

360 “Go, Persephone, to your mother, the
one with the dark robe.

Have a kindly disposition and thûmos in your
breast.

Do not be too upset, excessively so.

I will not be an unseemly husband to you,
in the company of the immortals.

I am the brother of Zeus the Father.

If you are here,
365 you will be queen of everything that lives

and moves about,
and you will have the greatest tîmai in the

company of the immortals.

Those who violate dikê– will get punishment
for all days to come

—those who do not supplicate your menos
with sacrifice,

performing the rituals in a reverent way,
executing perfectly the offerings that are

due.”

370 So he spoke.

And high-minded Persephone rejoiced.

Swiftly she set out, with joy.

But he [Hadês]
gave her, stealthily, the honey-sweet berry

of the pomegranate to eat,
peering around him.[43] He did not want her

to stay for all time
over there, at the side of her honorable mother,

the one with the dark robe.

375 The immortal horses were harnessed to
the golden chariot

by Hadês, the one who makes many sêmata.

She got up on the chariot, and next to her
was the powerful Argos-killer,

who took reins and whip into his philai hands
and shot out of the palace [of Hadês].

And the horses sped away eagerly.

380 Swiftly they made their way along the
long journey.

Neither the sea
nor the water of the rivers nor the grassy

valleys
nor the mountain peaks could hold up the onrush

of the immortal horses.

High over the peaks they went, slicing through
the vast air.

He came to a halt at the place where Demeter,
with the beautiful garlands in the hair,

385 was staying, at the forefront of the temple
fragrant with incense.

When she [Demeter] saw them,
she rushed forth like a maenad[44] down a

wooded mountainslope.

387-400[45]

401 But when the earth starts blossoming with
fragrant flowers of springtime,

flowers of every sort, then it is that you
must come up from the misty realms of darkness,

once again, a great thing of wonder to gods
and mortal humans alike.

But what kind of ruse was used to deceive
you by the powerful one, the one who receives

many guests?”[46]
405 She [Demeter] was answered by Persephone,

the most beautiful:
“So then, Mother, I shall tell you everything,

without error.

When the messenger came to me, the swift Argos-killer,
with the news from my father, the son of Kronos,

and from the other dwellers in the sky,
that I should come from Erebos, so that you

may see me with your own eyes
410 and let go of your wrath and terrible

mênis against the immortals,
then I sprang up for joy, but he, stealthily,

put into my hand the berry of the pomegranate,
that honey-sweet food,

and he compelled me by biâ to eat of it.

425 We were playing and gathering lovely flowers
in our hands,

an assortment of delicate crocus, iris, and
hyacinth,

rosebuds and lilies, a wonder to behold,
and the narcissus, which is grown, like the

crocus, by the wide earth.[47]
I was joyfully gathering the flowers, and

then the earth beneath me
430 gave way, and there it was that he sprang

out, the powerful lord who receives many guests.

He took me away under the earth in his golden
chariot.

It was very much against my will.

I cried with a piercing voice.

These things, grieving, I tell you, and they
are all alêthea.”

In this way did the two of them spend the
whole day, having a like-minded thûmos,[48]

435 and they gladdened greatly each other’s
heart and thûmos,

hugging each other, and their thûmos ceased
having akhos.

They received joy from each other, and gave
it.

Then Hekatê approached them, the one with
the splendid headband.

And she welcomed back the daughter of holy
Demeter with many embraces.

440 And from that day forward, the Lady [Hekatê]
became her [Persephone’s] attendant and

substitute queen.

Then the loud-thundering Zeus, who sees far
and wide, sent to them a messenger,

Rhea with the beautiful hair, to bring Demeter,
the one with the dark robe,

to join the company of the special group of
gods.

And he promised tîmai
that he would give to her [Demeter], which

she could receive in the company of the immortal
gods.

445 He [Zeus] assented that her daughter,
every time the season came round,

would spend a third portion of the year in
the realms of dark mist underneath,

and the other two thirds in the company of
her mother and the other immortals.

So he spoke, and the goddess [Rhea] did not
disobey the messages of Zeus…

And I’ll stop there.

Now, as you can probably see, the traditional
view of death among the Greeks of the Homeric

age was painted in a rather pessimistic light
– Hades was a house of dusty shades.

The deceased Achilles laments to Odysseus:
“O shining Odysseus, never try to console

me for dying.

I would rather follow the plough as thrall
to another man, one with no land allotted

to him and not much to live on, than be a
king over all the perished dead.”

From the Thracians perhaps[the Indo-European
barbarian peoples just north of Greece – these

were actually the ancestral lands of the Trojan/Phrygian
peoples, in case you ever wondered how the

Achaeans and the Trojans could talk with one
another], or perhaps from Egypt, or India,

or probably as an indigenous development which
was later externally attributed, the Greeks

got this idea that the soul was no different
than the crops – there gradually developed

a number of spiritual doctrines, first regarding
the existence of a soul altogether, then regarding

the soul’s immortality and the hope for
a beatific life after death.

We’ve been talking a lot about the development
of soteriological thinking in our time together.

So-called “Orphic” thought (which was
later taken up by the Pythagoreans), reformed

Dionysian myth and ritual to include a soteriological
system once the Greeks had established colonies

around the Black Sea and began their cultural
exchange with the Thracians.

One Orphic bone inscription from Olbia dated
to the 5th century BC reads “for Dion(ysos)

and Psyche,” revealing the importance of
a transcendent Soul in connection with the

Greek god of intoxication in Thracian territory.

This is also indicative of another version
of the famous Cupid and Psyche katabasis myth

(which lies at the root of our Beauty and
the Beast), wherein Dionysus replaces Cupid

(desire) as Psyche’s lover.

Another of these bone inscriptions containing
the words “Βιος Θανατος Βιος”

and marked with little 'Z’ pictograms (which
might represent little orphic serpents) reveals

the widespread and consistent nature of Dionysian
symbolism in regards to cyclical nature reaching

as far north as modern Ukraine.

In the shamanic mystery initiations as practiced
by the Orphic cults, it is quite likely that

incubation, near-death experiences, and the
use of dangerous doses of hallucinogenic plants

went hand in hand.

Whereas the Divine Bridegroom Sabazios (Dionysus)
was primarily the god who presided over ecstasy

and entheogenic intoxication, the Thracians
held him in equally high regard as a dying-and-rising

saviour god and a master over the souls of
the deceased.

Among the most famous of the ‘medicine-men’
in Thrace who revered the God of Intoxication

above all and who famously underwent katabaseis
of their own, were the mythic bard Orpheus,

the subterranean initiator Zalmoxis, the warden
of divine wine Maro, and the chthonic god-king

Rhesus – I’ve spoken of these individuals
elsewhere, but this is a good place to refresh

your memories….

Now, most writers of antiquity actually believed
in the historical veracity of Orpheus’ existence,

although his lifetime stretched far back in
the dimness of legend.

E.R. Dodds, the great scholar of Greek Irrationality,
held Orpheus to be “a Thracian figure of

much the same kind as Zalmoxis – a mythical
shaman or prototype of shamans.”

So…

Orpheus was both noble and semi-divine: he
was a prince (being the son of the muse Calliope

and the euhemerised king Oeagrus (who was
a Thracian wine-god)); in some another accounts,

he was the son of Apollo – a god of healing,
music and prophecy.

Now whether or not we should take this at
face value is another issue altogether, but

some guy we call Pseudo-Apollodorus accredits
Orpheus with the invention of the Dionysian

mysteries, that cult of women established
around sacred marriage and entheogenic intoxication,

and this I think is important.

Strabo buttresses this claim, telling us how
the rites of Orpheus first originated among

“the Cotytian and the Bendideian rites practiced
among the Thracians.”

He adds that “these rites resemble the Phrygian
rites, and it is at least not unlikely that,

just as the Phrygians themselves were colonists
from Thrace [which is true], so also their

sacred rites were borrowed from there.”

Now Orpheus was reputed to have travelled
widely, proselytizing the sacred doctrines

of the Goddess and her Divine Bridegroom throughout
the lands he wandered – now what were those

sacred doctrines?

We don’t really know, but it’s probable
that this Orpheus would have represented a

class of people rather than one individual
(like Homer), who were not unlike the Metragyrtai

of Cybele – wandering mendicants who proselytized
some kind of lost-and-found death-and-resurrection

Goddess myth and its associated mysteries.

So… for example, in Aegina, Orpheus is said
to have established the rites of Hekate, and

in Laconia he introduced the quasi-Eleusinian
rites of Demeter Chthonia (The Subterranean

Mother), both of which were centered on the
erection of a wooden image.

The shamanic character of Orpheus is very
well attested among both ancient and modern

sources: He was simultaneously prince, prophet,
healer, musician, and guardian of ecstatic

mysteries.

He possessed the ability to charm wild beasts
and control natural phenomena.

He performed a καταβασις, descending
into the underworld on a spiritual quest to

return the soul of his beloved Eurydice from
Hades and Proserpina.

And even his decapitated head was a source
of oracular power, having been severed by

Dionysus’ Maenads for having embraced solar
monotheism at the end of his life.

Orpheus’ decapitated head was basically
used as an oracle in the same way the Yukagir

shaman used skulls, or the head of Mimir which
Odin used to divulge information about other

realms in the Heimskringla and Völuspá.

Ultimately, the importance of Orpheus lay
predominantly in rites which he established

which were said to affirm the immortality
of the soul – reincarnation (or metempsychosis

in the Greek tradition) is more or less the
only thing we can say with any certainty that

the Orphics and the Pythagoreans believed.

The mysteries of Dionysus and its associated
myths, as embodied in the ostensibly savage

rites of the maenads in Euripides’ Bacchae
were born out of a long mythico-religious

tradition stretching back into Palaeolithic
shamanism and orgiastic goddess worship.

But it was probably the Orphic movement based
out of Thrace, which took this marginalized

female-dominated cult and brought it into
the fold of the “civilized” and the masculine,

into Greek philosophy (so this was all happening
slowly from about the 8th century BC to about

the 5th).

The poet and translator Robert Graves was
very interested in this issue.

But ultimately, in Orpheus we have the embodiment
of the masculine Thracian heroic ideal – a

noble priest-king skilled in magical arts
and a founder of an ecstatic god’s sacred

rites – the model candidate for immortality.

Rhesus, a Thracian king (his name literally
means King) who appears in the Iliad and a

tragedy attributed to Euripides, exhibits
many of the archetypes that defined the ideal

Thracian man as well.

In Euripides’ tragedy, a messenger proclaims
to Hector: “I see Rhesus mounted like a

god upon his Thracian chariot.

Of gold was the yoke that linked the necks
of his steeds whiter than the snow; and on

his shoulders flashed his targe with figures
welded in gold” He was the son of a river-god

and a muse and during his life he exhibited
godlike skills in war.

He possessed a passion for gold, horses and
the mystery rites imparted by Orpheus, the

prophet of Bacchus.

Upon his death, Rhesus did not descend into
Hades to a life of bleak wandering and forgetfulness

but rather to achieve some sort of chthonic
godhood.

The Thracian king’s mother, an unnamed muse,
declares that:

He shall not descend into earth's darksome
soil; so earnest a prayer will I address to

the bride of the nether world, the daughter
of the goddess Demeter, giver of increase,

to release his soul, and debtor, as she is
to me, show that she honours the friends of

Orpheus.

Yet from henceforth will he be to me as one
dead that seeth not the light; for never again

will he meet me or see his mother's face,
but will lurk hidden in a cavern of the land

with veins of silver, restored to life, no
longer man but god, even as the prophet of

Bacchus did dwell in a grotto beneath Pangaeus,
a god whom his votaries honoured.

In any case, I’m showing you this to indicate
how the Greek conceptualization of the Thracians,

was set in the idea that immortality came
to those who underwent some sort of Orphic

initiation – THERE IS NO SALVATION OUTSIDE
OF INITIATION.

The Orphics by way of the Pythagoreans, and
the Pythagoreans by way of the Platonists

then doubtless played an incalculable role
in priming the Greco-Roman world for the breakdown

of the polis, the rise of the individual;
the rise of manifold mystical philosophies;

and the new soteriological dimensions of religion.

No more were people looking to carve out a
place in this world, by the Hellenistic era,

they needed to be saved from it.

The Katabasis and the Anabasis are indispensible
factors to this mass reconceptualization of

the world, whether for good or ill.

If you have not fallen, you cannot be lifted
up.

If you have not died you cannot be reborn.

Well alright, I suppose talking about Thrace
makes for a nice Segway to talk about Ovid,

since he was famously exiled to Thracian lands
(in Modern Romania) after being exposed (along

with a great number of other men) for a series
of indiscretions with Augustus’ daughter.

In Ovid's poetic collection of mythological
stories, he includes accounts of katabaseis

as well.

In book 4, Juno descent to Hades not unlike
Inanna did millennia before her.

Ovid describes Cerberus, the Furies, and so
forth - while in the underworld, Juno passes

several famous souls who are being punished
in Hades–Tantalus parched with thirst, Sisyphus

pushing his rock, and Ixion on his wheel – this
kind of thing (seeing the souls of the wicked

being punished in hell) was a trope and would
long endure, and everyone from Homer to Dante

just delighted describing these episodes.

I’m reminded of William Blake’s famous
words concerning the literary titan John Milton:

“The reason Milton wrote in fetters when
he wrote of Angels & God, and at liberty when

of Devils & Hell, is because he was a true
Poet and of the Devils party without knowing

it.”

The fact is, hell and chaos is the wellspring
of unbridled creativity, whereas heaven is

orderly and perfect, and in no need of additional
creativity, so this all seems to check out

to me…

So the next major katabasis in the Metamorphoses
occurs in book 5 by Prosperina, the daughter

of Ceres who is kidnapped by Dis.

We’ve literally just gone over this in the
Homeric Hymn to Demeter, which was obvious

one of Ovid’s sources – he’s just given
his own account in Latin meter, with all of

the equivalent Latin names (for the uninitiated:
Proserpina is Kore/Persephone, Ceres is Demeter,

and Dis is Hades.

Ovid also briefly mentions the katabasis of
Hercules in book 7.

He tells the story behind the sorceress Medea's
poison for Theseus, during which Hercules

travels to the underworld – past the gates
of death and sleep - to capture Cerberus as

one of his twelve Labours, but this infernal
three-headed dog spreads a white foam from

his mouths which grew poisonous plants.

This is a pretty common motif in the ancient
world (whether in the Near East or around

the Mediterranean) – that is, that “poison
plants” and the underworld are thematically

linked… hmmm I wonder why: well obviously
they grow out of the earth, and if you take

them, you can either be killed, or transported
to what was ostensibly the threshold of death,

which is an area populated by all manner of
spectres and frightening hallucinations.

The katabasis of Orpheus is again featured
in book 10, and it’s the last major inclusion

of the motif by Ovid in the Metamorphoses.

So again…

Orpheus is distressed by the death of his
wife, Eurydice.

He enters the underworld and visits Dis and
Prosperina to beg for her return.

Overcome by Orpheus’ warm lyre-playing,
Prosperina permits Eurydice to leave with

her husband–on the condition that he does
not look back until he reaches the exit, Sodom

and Gomorrah style.

Well, fact is he does looks back, and his
wife disappears, and all his toils are in

vain.

Now as far as the Romans are concerned, probably
the most famous Katabasis motif (and definitely

the one that inspired Dante), was the one
which appears in the Aeneid of Virgil.

I suppose it only now just dawned on me that
technically, Aeneas is technically a Thracian

princeling of sorts too!

Now, after Troy was destroyed in its last
battle against the Acheans, Aeneas left the

burning wreckage of his city and began his
quest to find a new home.

Now after being wracked by many sorrows and
tribulations, Aeneas arrived in Italy where

he envisioned founding a race destined for
greatness.

Now in Cumae, at the Temple of Apollo, the
sibylline oracle - an old woman purported

to be over seven hundred years old - agrees
to escort him on a chthonic journey into the

underworld in order that he might see the
shade of his dead father.

Now before entering Hades, the oracle tells
Aeneas he must obtain “the golden bough”

(a golden branch from a tree that grew nearby
in the woods around her cave (which I suspect

is a mushroom, but I won’t get into that
here, especially since like Moses and his

Burning Bush, Aeneas isn’t a historical
person).

Now this golden bough Aeneas is supposed to
give as a gift to Proserpina.

Aeneas's mother, the goddess Venus, sends
two doves to aid him in this difficult task

(doves are traditionally associated with Anabaseis,
while serpents are typically associated with

Katabasis), and these helped him to find the
tree with the Golden Bough.

Now when Aeneas tears off the branch, a second
golden one springs up straightaway, which

is a good omen.

Shortly after they begin their descent, the
sibyl shows the golden bough to Charon who

considers it payment and allows them to enter
his boat and cross the Stygian river.

On the other side of Styx, the Sibyl uses
her typical knowledge of soporific plants

to sedate Cerberus.

Once in the Underworld proper, Aeneas tries
talking to some shades in vain, and he listens

to the Sybil speak of places like Tartarus,
where he beholds a tremendous prison, fenced

by a high threefold wall, wherein the wicked
are punished.

In the House of Hades itself, in Pluto’s
palace, Aeneas places the golden bough on

the arched door, and goes through to the blessed
Elysian Fields, a kind of pocket-plane within

Hell where dwell the men who lived just and
useful lives.

Now this is where Anchises, the father of
dutiful Aeneas, was finally found - in lush

and verdant Elysium, by the beautiful river
Eridanus.

There Aeneas tries to hug his father three
times, but like in an empty dream, his father's

shade could not be touched.

Now despite this, they manage to have a metadimensional
chat, and Anchises tells his son about the

nearby river Lethe, the river of forgetfulness
(something I’ve sure many of you have crossed

on your way back from your underworld descents).

Now in the Aeneid, on the other side of this
river, there’s actually a multitude of spirits

waiting to be born on Earth – hopefully
this reminds you a bit of Plato’s Myth of

Er I mentioned earlier – the underworld
has all kinds of tubes or tunnels, jutting

off in all manner of directions for different
souls.

From across the river, Aeneas sees his very
own descendants - those who would live in

the future Roman Empire, such as Romulus and
Caesars (let’s never forget now that the

Aeneid, like Dante’s Inferno, is as much
a piece of political propaganda as it is a

journey of the soul – there’s some nice
ekphrasis, and so on and so forth…) but

at this point Anchises gives Aeneas advice,
and leads him to the ivory gate of "Sleep"

(as opposed to the gate of death), through
which they return to reality, or Earth, or

whatever you want to call re-embodiment.

Alright so, there are countless other examples,
and there’s really much more to be said

on the subject, but I haven’t the time to
delve too deeply into this today.

I suppose the least I can do before leaving
you is to tell you how this relates to Hermeticism?

Well, Hermes was the psychopomp - a fancy
word which elides the two Greek words “psyche”

(soul) and “pompos” (guide).

When Demeter wants to get Persephone back
from the underworld, she sends Hermes.

He’s the intermediary – like the Ningizzida
of the Grecian Mother (they even share the

same symbol, the Caduceus).

But even this is a mainly superficial connection…
what’s important is the motif of the journey

of the soul.

This is a shamanic motif, it goes far back
beyond the written record, and it is central

to the humanity’s understanding of a soul.

The idea was, that if you were in a society
which prized the body above all things (such

as Pagan Greek society where, if you remember,
people were conceptualized as the sum of their

limbs), but then you could ostensibly leave
this body and travel to other realms without

it, then there must be some kind of kernel
– some kind of divine spark at the center

of Man – which was independent from the
body.

Now whether this is true or not is something
we’ll continue to explore together, but

interest in this divine spark would begin
to ramp up significantly between say, the

3rd century BC and the 3rd century AD, and
all kinds of mystical literature about this

subject (whether Jewish, Greek, Latin, Egyptian,
Indian, or whatever) would proliferate.

The writings of the Stoics, the Gnostics,
the Neoplatonists, the Hermeticists, and so

forth, would all tap into this current, and
elaborate on it, and debate it, such that

I think it would be appropriate to say that
out of the Axial Age (this age of great spiritual

teachers) came the Age of the Soul, wherein
the individual consciousness (in its irreducibility)

became the most important subject of philosophical
inquiry.

Now these are all things we’ll discuss in
the future in more detail, and when we come

back, we’ll talk about the Anabasis, the
ascent into Heaven motif, which goes hand

in hand, like yin and yang, with the Katabasis
motif, and was just as vital to this question

about the soul as its negative counterpart.

Until then, hopefully this can be a kind of
springboard into thinking about this very

long and beautiful thread which runs through
the Western Cannon.

For now, you’ve been listening Encyclopedia
Hermetica: A Big History, and I’m Dan Attrell.
